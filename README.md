This android app sounds alarm when on your phone when your headphones are removed from the jack (tested with 3.5 mm jack).
Useful for protecting your phone from pickpocket during travel in rush hour.

Right now it uses the media output channel. Therefore make sure that your media volume is significantly high.

Works only when the app is open (also works when app is minimised or screen is off).
